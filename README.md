# shell-cpp
A simple posix shell in C++, based on codecrafters course.
=======

In this challenge, we built our own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. (Some commands still need to be implemented!!)
